We are building a fuel payment web app.



Customer selects fuel amount → app applies internal discount logic →
customer sees reduced payable amount in the newxt screen and savings →
customer completes payment by choose the option form cash/card/ upi /net banking→
success screen shows auth code (OTP which is already featching form the sheet) →
home screen shows savings summary.

This is a WEB APP, not a native app.
